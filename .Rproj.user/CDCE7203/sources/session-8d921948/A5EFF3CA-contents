# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a book with problems that help students learn how to code in R. The problems in this book are typically *not* going to be data related, but rather problems related to logical coding exercises.

The idea of this book comes from having seen many students struggle in introductory coding courses, particularly due to the lack of any coding experience. It is my belief that the best way to learn R, is to do. So this book contains sets of problems towards this goal.

The problems (and solutions) in this book are due to the efforts of the following students:
